#JavaScript Introduction

* invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape, Inc
* has nothing to do with Java -- Java and JavaScript are two completely different langauges
* invented as a way to allow programs to run in web browsers
* meets ECMASscript (European Computer Manufacturers Association) standard (as does ActionScript)

##client-side vs server-side

* php is server-side
* JavaScript is client-side
* (server-side JavaScript is also possible now, but we're going to ignore that)

##Example
