#JavaScript Introduction

* invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape, Inc
* has nothing to do with Java -- Java and JavaScript are two completely different langauges
* invented as a way to allow programs to run in web browsers
* meets ECMASscript (European Computer Manufacturers Association) standard (as does ActionScript)

##client-side vs server-side

* php is server-side
* JavaScript is client-side
* (server-side JavaScript is also possible now, but we're going to ignore that)

##example1.html

* Hello World!

##example2.html / example2.js

* Same as example1, but with JavaScript in a separate file

##example3.html

* A more complicated HTML structure.

##example4.html

* Arranging for JS code to run immediately on page load
* HTML page elements are not available until page has finished loading!
* body "onload" attribute.

##example5.html

* Same as example4, but with CSS styling.
* DOM concepts
  * elements / attributes - nested structure
  * "selectors" for targeting objects in DOM

##example6.html

* divs and spans: useful containers for organizing the structure of a page.  Like tables, but more flexible.
* 'class' vs 'id' attributes
* Google Chrome dev tools: view HTML structure, see console log

##example7.html

* introducing jQuery
* $ / jQuery function
* jQuery selectors: 'document', '#wilma', '#betty'
* anonymous functions
* asynchronicity, 'callback' functions

##example7.html

* registering event handlers

##JavaScript Language Fundamentals

* syntax similar to php and many other C-inspired languages
* variables declared with `var` statement
* scoping

#Other things to cover

* javascript objects, properties
* json - JavaScript Object Notation
* ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and Xml), web services
